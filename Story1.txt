As the sun sets over a desolate highway motel, a juice-soaked writer confronts his inner demons in a fevered battle of words, culminating in a midnight showdown that could either save his soul or seal his fate. 

Every sunset brigns the promise of new dawn. It is almost impossible to watch a sunset and not dream of the inner demons.

The juice drips from the writer's beard drop by drop onto the disgusting motel carpet. He awaits for something, although he knows not what.

We are not having the quiz today

Dear Kyle, this class was surprisingly difficult for some people. I am not sure how we could make this section of the class easier
or alleviate the challenge for some students. Git can be difficult to comprehend, so I hope you and TJ find a good solution to this
for future classes. Also, authentication errors don't help make Git any easier :(
