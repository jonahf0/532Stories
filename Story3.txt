Amidst the cheerful chaos of Disney World, a disenchanted park employee contemplates the meaning of happiness while cleaning up after ecstatic visitors.

He thinks, "Wow, life sucks!"
And then... the Mouse appears...
He says, "How could you say that when stuff like this exists?" He then pulls out a giant cartoon hammer
and hits a kid in the head.
"Wow," the employee thinks, "that IS great!"

Then one of the magical dogs appear.
The employee takes the hammer 
from the mouse and hits the dog 
over the head with the hammer. 
Because he has a phobia of dogs.
Needless to say, he got fired

The mouse is in awe of what he witness that day...
The contemplates the magical aura of Disney land and truly wonders if things are magical.
